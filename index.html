		<p>B01lers, formally the Purdue Capture the Flag team, is a long-standing club here at Purdue.
			The club competes in cybersecurity competitions.
			Together, the club hacks their way throughout the world, landing top spots in major competitions globally.
			This year, the club continues its legacy, standing top 100 in the world and top 6 in the US.</p>
		<p>CTF is a cybersecurity competition that lets the participants sharpen their skills in security.
			From exploitation to digital forensics, the competition encompasses different fields in security, presenting
			the knowledge in bite-sized chunks.
			The participants can practice their craft through solving those challenges.</p>

		<p><em>Figure 2. Number of cybersecurity professional and job openings in the US from 2010 to 2024</em></p>
		<p>For the past 10 years, the demand of cybersecurity professionals has steadily increased.
			As shown in the graph, number of professionals has doubled over the last ten years, creating 6 million
			positions in the united state alone.
			The number of job openings has also remained relatively stable.
			The data suggests that cybersecurity positions will provide great career stability.</p>

		<p><em>Figure 3. Meeting in progress - Presentation</em></p>
		<p>The boot camp is a long running tradition to the b01lers club.
			During this month long adventure, officers guides the participants through the challenging field of
			cybersecurity.
			Each meeting consists of high level overview of the topic, followed with small coding challenges designed to
			test the participants' learning progress.
			Coming in with no prior experience, the boot camp trains the member with applicable knowledge to start the
			journey on this adventure.
			Every year, b01lers attracts hundreds of new members through this boot camp program.</p>
		<p>During normal club meetings, people came together to share their knowledge and compete in CTFs together.
			Routinely, there are topic sessions for members to teach each others.
			Afterall, teaching others helps you learn better as well.</p>
		<p><img src="images/meeting2.png" alt="Presentation 2"></p>
		<p><em>Figure 4. Meeting in progress - Presentation</em></p>
		<p>One particular themes across the meetings are the unique culture and atmosphere among the members.
			Being hackers in spirit, the club members resonates together in nerdiness and quirks.
			The extensive meme culture incorporated into the slide shows, giving every participants an unforgettable
			memory.
			In the photo above you can see a great example of how this informality shines.</p>
		<p><img src="images/meeting3.png" alt="alt text"></p>
		<p><em>Figure 5. Meeting in progress - Discussion</em></p>
		<p>Aside from the topic sessions, the club's main activity is to compete in CTF, as the name suggests.
			The members spreads throughout the room, finding people to collaborate on the challenges.
			As the type of challenges change, people bundles up into different groups that have different knowledge.
			This further enhances the communication among the members.</p>
		<p>More often than not, CTF will propose challenges that are novel or distinct from school course work.
			This requires us to learn new techniques on the fly, applying our general knowledge in cybersecurity in a
			new form to solve those challenges.
			Therefore, the participants can practice learning new concepts, and how to apply those concepts in a
			different setting.
			This improves people's problem solving skills, which is highly valuable both in the job market and in real
			life.</p>

			<em>Figure 7. Serving sandwiches during club meetings</em>
		</p>
		<p>The club serve dinner during meeting, making sure that members are well fed to focus on the competitions.
			Typically, the club orders pizza, as it's easier to share.
			Occasionally, there will be different types of food, like sandwiches.</p>

		<p><em>Figure 8. Watching Purdue v.s. IU games together</em></p>
		<p>Aside from competitions, b01lers form a welcoming community.
			The members meet together and enjoys varies activities together.
			During the Purdue v.s. IU basketball game, we gather together to watch the game live.
			With various activities spread throughout the year, people found different ways to engage with the community.

		<p><em>Figure 9. Snowy night sky after the meeting</em></p>
		<p>After a long day of class and a joyful club session, only the snowy night sky greets everyone.
		   With the new learned knowledge, members leave the club room, ready to tackle the next challenge.
